# GitHub Pages (Admin)

- **Settings:** Repo → Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → branch `gh-pages`, folder `/ (root)`.
- **Build/deploy:** See [BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md](./BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md) (Method 3). Admin-deploy workflow can use GitHub Pages as fallback when Vercel/Netlify secrets are missing.
- **Private repo:** GitHub Pages needs GitHub Pro/Team. Public repos: free.
